Theme no 5: ü§ñAI
üí°Idea: NFT Based AI Music Marketplace
**Introducing MeloSynthiaAI, the decentralized NFT-based music marketplace that empowers users to generate lyrics and music with AI.**  

Our platform allows users to create their own unique music and lyrics, which can then be minted as NFTs and sold or traded on our marketplace. This gives users the opportunity to explore their creativity and earn money from their work.

It also facilitates people to buy NFTs from other users to use in their own songs. This also creates a new way for users,      musicians or artists to collaborate and create innovative new music.

## ‚ú®Features

- **AI-powered music generation:** Our platform uses AI to generate lyrics and music that are both original and creative.
- **Song Snippets:** Users can add their vocals and ask AI to generate a song for them accordingly.
- **NFT mining:** Users can mint their generated creation as NFTs for free,which can then be sold or traded on our marketplace.
- **Decentralized Marketplace:** Our marketplace is decentralized, which means that users have control over their own music and lyrics.
- **Collaboration:** Users can buy NFTs from other users to use in their own songs.

## üë®‚ÄçüíªContributing

Contributions are always welcome!

To merge your changes from the cloned repository back into the original repository on GitHub, you typically follow these steps:

- Step 1: Add the original repository as a remote (if you haven't done it already)

Navigate to the directory of your local clone:

```bash
cd /path/to/local/clone/
```

Add the original repository as a remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream <original_repository_url>
```

In the command above, <original_repository_url> should be replaced with the URL of the original repository. This step is important because it establishes a connection between your local repository and the original repository.

- Step 2: Commit and push your changes to your forked repository

Stage your changes

```bash
git add .
```

Commit the changes

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

Push the changes to your forked repository

```bash
git push origin master
```

- Step 3: Create a pull request on the original repository

Now, go to the original repository on GitHub and create a pull request from your forked repository.
