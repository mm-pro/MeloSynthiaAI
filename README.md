üí°Idea: NFT Based AI Music Marketplace

**Introducing MeloSynthiaAI, the decentralized NFT-based music marketplace that empowers users to generate lyrics and music with AI.**  

Introducing MeloSynthiaAI

An AI-Empowered NFT Marketplace

MeloSynthiaAI is an AI-empowered NFT marketplace that revolutionizes the idea of creating NFTs. With MeloSynthiaAI, anyone can express their ideas via prompt and generate musical NFTs for free, which they can then list for sale on the platform. This superpower for users pushes the limits of AI by making their creations as NFTs available for sale and purchase.

The platform also unlocks user superpower by offering users the ability to generate not only music but also lyrics in the section named "Lyrical AI." In this feature, users can generate lyrics by simply giving a prompt on the UI.

Tron Network is used in the platform to provide seamless transactions with high speed, less expense, and more security while buying and selling musical artpieces on MeloSynthiaAI.

To add some more AI magic to the NFT marketplace, MeloSynthiaAI has come up with an AI-enabled chatbot called MeloBot. This AI-powered bot is designed to guide users, even those with no blockchain background, from answering questions like "What are NFTs?" to "How can I make collections of NFTs on MeloSynthiaAI?" MeloBot will help users become an immersive part of the blockchain world.

The platform also creates a new way for users, musicians, or artists to collaborate and create innovative new music, and even follow their favorite artists/creators.
